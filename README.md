# Quantum-based-LFSR-
Quantum random number generators are used for providing secure communication. This project presents a novel Quantum LFSR, designed using the novel construction of D-Flip-Flop(DFF) and XOR gates in QCA. The suggested Quantum LFSR comprises 216 cells with an area of 0.23Âµm2 and the total power dissipation is 0.31442 eV, 0.41729 eV, and 0.54389 eV at different standard tunneling energy levels. The power parameters are analyzed using QCA Pro and the calculated outcomes show that the Quantum LFSR has low power consumption and reduced footprint compared to conventional designs.
